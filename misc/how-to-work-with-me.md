# How to Work With Me — Adriana

## Communication
- **Primary channel:** Slack  
- If you need me in a Slack channel, **always @ me**.  
- I prefer **Slack over email or meetings** whenever possible.  
- **Response times:**  
  - Slack: 10 minutes–2 hours depending on urgency  
  - Email: within 1 business day  
  - While traveling for business: Slack replies may take **several hours**  
- If you tag me in **GitHub, Google Docs, MS Office, or SharePoint**, follow up with a Slack message.  
- I prefer **reading** over watching videos.  
- I keep most notifications off; only Slack DMs and @ mentions reach me, and sound is disabled.

## Availability
- **Time zone:** Eastern Time (Toronto)  
- **Core meeting hours:** 09:30–12:30 ET  
- **Preferred start:** 10:00 ET (I tend to work later if I start later).
- **Early meetings:** Rare exceptions, never earlier than 08:30 ET.  
- **Deep work windows:**  
  - Mon–Thu: 12:30–18:00 ET  
  - Fri: 09:00–18:00 ET  
- I do **not** check Slack or email after **18:00 ET** on weekdays, and **never** on weekends.

## Collaboration
- I’m happy with **async collaboration**; please keep me updated on progress.  
- **Do not volunteer me** for work without checking first.  
- **Please go through my manager** for any requests involving my time.  
- If you need me to take on a **new task**, I will need to **reprioritize** other work accordingly.  
- Please give me **sufficient lead time** for tasks. I work quickly, but unexpected things come up.  
- When I’m focused, I’m fully focused and distract easily, which is why notifications and sounds are off.  
- I sometimes get **creative inspiration at odd times**—before bed, on walks, or whenever my brain sparks.

## Feedback & Growth
- I’m **not opposed to change**. I enjoy learning new things, and I’ll pivot quickly if something isn’t working.  
- I like **refining tasks** to make them better.  
- I welcome **constructive feedback**. I may react a bit abrasively at first, but I always take feedback seriously. Once it percolates, if it makes sense, I’ll adopt it wholeheartedly.

## Personal Quirks
- Please excuse my **facial expressions**—I’m told they can be unintentionally weird, and I often don’t realize I’m making them.  
- I’m **not into formality**. I bring my full self to work, which can include swearing, goofy remarks, and general informality. It’s never meant to offend—if anything, it means I feel comfortable around you.

## Values
- I take **pride in my work**.  
- I value teammates who are **respectful**, reliable, and who **pull their weight** when collaborating.
